# GANerate your dreams
In this project, we're experimenting with CycleGANs to map images from one style to another style. The goal is to prepare a generic framework to make it easy to map any to styles to each other. The implementation was then tested on multiple datasets.

This work is based on [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) paper.
